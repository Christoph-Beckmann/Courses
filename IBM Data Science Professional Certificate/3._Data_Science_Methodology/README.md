## Syllabus

### Week 1: From Problem to Approach and From Requirements to Collection
-   List the six key stages of the Cross-Industry Process for Data Mining Methodology (CRISP-DM), an industry-standard data science methodology.
-   Analyze the first four phases of CRISP-DM.
-   Apply the first four phases of the data science methodology to a case study.
-   Write clearly defined questions that address a business problem.
-   Analyze a case study to determine data requirements.
-   Apply the data science methodology to a case study.
-   Determine data content, data formats, and data sources prior to data collection and data preparation phases.
-   Create a decision tree to classify outcomes in a case study.
-   Identify appropriate data sources to address a business problem.

### Week 2: From Understanding to Preparation and From Modeling to Evaluation
-   Prepare a data set by handling missing, invalid, or misleading data.
-   Describe the purpose and characteristics of the data modeling process.
-   Evaluate a decision tree model using a training and a test dataset.
-   Build a decision to tree to determine the cuisine type for a data set of recipes.
-   Summarize the processes of understanding data preparing data, modeling, and evaluation phases of the data science methodology.

### Week 3: • From Deployment to Feedback
-   Describe the deployment and feedback phases of the data science methodology.
-   Judge when a model is ready to deploy.
-   Devise a plan to elicit feedback from stakeholders involved in the data analysis process.
-   Examine how feedback helps to refine a model.
-   Assess the performance and impact of a data model.
-   Explain why deployment and feedback should be an iterative process.
-   Devise a business problem to be solved with data related to either email, hospitals, or credit cards.
-   Demonstrate your understanding of data science methodology by applying it to a given problem. Construct responses that address each phase of the CRISP-DM based on a chosen business problem.
-   Evaluate your peers’ final projects using the given rubric. Provide constructive feedback and offer ideas and suggestions that fellow learners can apply right away.
