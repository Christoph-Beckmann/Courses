## Syllabus 

### Week 1: Data Scientist's Toolkit
-   Cite popular open source, commercial, and cloud-based tools used by data scientists.
-   Explain the function of an API and list some common API-related terms.
-   Discuss the characteristics of a dataset and the ways data can be structured.
-   Identify  some of the libraries used in data science and the types of functionalities a library can provide.
-   Compare and contrast between machine learning, deep learning and their use cases.
-   Discuss the different classes of machine learning models.
-   Summarize the advantages of using a pre-trained model as opposed to training a model from scratch.
-   Identify the languages, tools, and data used by data scientists.
-   Access and explore data sets in the Data Asset Exchange (DAX).
-   Examine deep learning models on the Model Asset Exchange (MAX) and interact with an image-detection deep learning model.

### Week 2: Open Source Tools
-   Describe the fundamentals of Jupyter Notebooks and the JupyterLab platform and why they are popular for data science projects.
-   Cite some examples of how Jupyter is used in data science for recording experiments and projects.
-   Use Jupyter notebooks to experiment with code cells, create data visualization slides, and reporting results using Markdown.
-   Create a Jupyter notebook with Python and use it to run code, change kernels, and save your work.
-   Define the R programming language and discuss its application in data science.
-   Use RStudio packages to experiment with plotting.
-   Explain versioning, branching and why they’re vital to the software development process.
-   Create, edit. and upload new files in GitHub.
-   Use GitHub to create a branch, commit changes, and initiate a pull request.

### Week 3: IBM Tools for Data Science
-   Define the Watson Studio.
-   Explain how Watson Studio can streamline data projects and make them easier to manage.
-   List some of the primary assets included in Watson Studio.
-   Create a project in Watson Studio and add an interactive Jupyter workbook to work with a real data set. Link GitHub to Watson Studio and explain when to use public vs. private repositories.
-   Describe other tools essential to data science and their applications.
-   Describe Data Refinery and how it benefits the data scientists who use it.
-   Describe the IBM SSPS Modeler, its usage, and some of the capabilities it offers.
-   Load and run a sample project in Watson Studio and examine the results.
-   Use Watson Studio to run an autonumeric model, examine the results and get predictions for new use cases.
-   Describe the use case for the IBM SPSS Modeler and list a few of its main features.
-   Summarize the characteristics of the IBM SPSS Statistics software application and its use by data scientists.
-   Explain how models are deployed into production environments.
-   Summarize how Auto AI in Watson Studio benefits organizations who lack a fully staffed data science team.
-   List the features included with IBM Watson and explain how it ensures fairness and explainability of model drift.

### Week 4: Final Assignment: Create and Share Your Jupyter Notebook
- Create and share a public Jupyter notebook, in any language, in Watson Studio and create markdown cells for peer review.
- Evaluate and grade final assignments submitted by fellow learners using the given rubric. Provide constructive feedback and offer ideas and suggestions that fellow learners can apply right away.
